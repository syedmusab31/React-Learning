# React Counter App

This is a simple React application built using Vite. The app demonstrates a basic counter functionality with increment and decrement features.

## Features

- Built with React and Vite for fast development.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for seamless updates during development.
- ESLint integration for code quality and consistency.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-counter
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
